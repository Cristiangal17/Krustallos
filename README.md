This is an app that reads through tdifferent store inventory sheets and then counts how many items were sold in the different stores.
The script then creates different files that will have updated inventory information.


#Reason for app
We have about 5 different online stores. This means that if items were sold in one store, then the other stores did not know 
about that item being sold. This lead to having to incorrect inventory ammounts in the different stores. This program aims to help update inventories
throughout multiple online stores.
